Based on the provided context and JSON schema, I will parse the content and provide the output in JSON format. Here is the parsed output:

```
{
  "bank_name": "ABC Bank, Inc",
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Goldman Sachs Bank",
      "term_loan_commitment": "$7,000,000",
      "total_commitment": "$40,000,000",
      "percentage": "17.5%",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bank of America",
      "term_loan_commitment": "$3,000,000",
      "total_commitment": "$40,000,000",
      "percentage": "7.5%",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    {
      "name": "Chase",
      "term_loan_commitment": "$10,000,000",
      "total_commitment": "$40,000,000",
      "percentage": "25%",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    {
      "name": "Truist Bank",
      "term_loan_commitment": "$20,000,000",
      "total_commitment": "$40,000,000",
      "percentage": "50%",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that I've combined the data from all the documents into a single JSON object, with the `bank_name` field populated from the last document, and the `data` array containing all the lender information from the other documents.
